These articles are categorized according to their contributions in the various SA techniques. The related fields to SA (transfer learning, emotion detection, and building resources) that attracted researchers recently are discussed. The main target of this survey is to give nearly full image of SA techniques and the related fields with brief details. The main contributions of this paper include the sophisticated categorizations of a large number of recent articles and the illustration of the recent trend of research in the sentiment analysis and its related areas."

However, often it is impossible to identify a sentence containing sarcasm without knowing the context. In this paper we describe a corpus generation experiment where we collect regular and sarcastic Amazon product reviews. We perform qualitative and quantitative analysis of the corpus. The resulting corpus can be used for identifying sarcasm on two levels: a document and a text utterance (where a text utterance can be as short as a sentence and as long as a whole document).",

These reviews exist in different forms like social Medias, blogs, Wiki or forum websites. Both travelers and customers find the information in these reviews to be beneficial for their understanding and planning processes. The boom of search engines like Yahoo and Google has flooded users with copious amount of relevant reviews about specific destinations, which is still beyond human comprehension. Sentiment Analysis poses as a powerful tool for users to extract the needful information, as well as to aggregate the collective sentiments of the reviews. Several methods have come to the limelight in recent years for accomplishing this task.

We show that SO-CAL's performance is consistent across domains and in completely unseen data. Additionally, we describe the process of dictionary creation, and our use of Mechanical Turk to check dictionaries for consistency and reliability. }
